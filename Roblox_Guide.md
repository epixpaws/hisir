### What Does the Admin GUI Do?

The admin script provides game owners/administrators with tools to:

1. **Player Management**
   - View all players in the server
   - Kick disruptive players
   - Ban problematic users
   - Warn players for rule violations
   - Teleport players to your location

2. **Server Control**
   - Send server-wide announcements
   - Monitor server statistics (player count, uptime)
   - Reset server data
   - Emergency server shutdown

3. **Live Monitoring**
   - Real-time event tracking
   - Player join/leave notifications
   - Admin action logging
   - Timestamped activity feed

4. **Modern Interface**
   - Apple-inspired dark theme design
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Blur effects and modern styling
   - Easy-to-use navigation

### How to Use the Admin GUI in Your Roblox Game

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Roblox Game
1. Open **Roblox Studio**
2. Create a new place or open an existing one
3. Go to the **Explorer** window (shows your game's structure)

#### Step 2: Install the Admin Script
1. In the Explorer, find **ServerScriptService**
2. Right-click on ServerScriptService
3. Select **Insert Object** > **Script**
4. Delete the default code in the script
5. Copy and paste the entire `AdminGUI.lua` code I created
6. Rename the script to "AdminGUI" or "AppleAdmin"

#### Step 3: Configure Admin Access
1. Find this section in the script:
```lua
local ADMIN_USERS = {
    [LocalPlayer.UserId] = true, -- Add your user ID here
    -- Add more admin user IDs as needed
}
```

2. Replace `LocalPlayer.UserId` with your actual Roblox User ID
3. To find your User ID:
   - Go to your Roblox profile
   - Look at the URL: `roblox.com/users/[YOUR_USER_ID]/profile`
   - Copy the number and add it to the script

Example:
```lua
local ADMIN_USERS = {
    [123456789] = true, -- Your User ID
    [987654321] = true, -- Friend's User ID
    -- Add more as needed
}
```

#### Step 4: Test the Admin GUI
1. Click **Play** in Roblox Studio to test your game
2. Once in-game, press **Right Control** to open the admin GUI
3. The GUI should appear with the Apple-style interface
4. Test the different features (player management, announcements, etc.)

#### Step 5: Publish Your Game
1. Go to **File** > **Publish to Roblox As...**
2. Give your game a name and description
3. Choose if it's public or private
4. Click **Create** to publish
